# intro

* let's talk web perf
* csaba
* audience
* overview

# user-centric metrics

* old stuff has nothing to with UX
* not a single metric - visual
* how users think?
* metrics from where?
* happening: start render, fp, fcp
* meaningful: visually complete, fmp
* meaningful: hero element timing
* usable: custome marks + tti
* smooth: long tasks, input latency

# real user monitoring
* all users have a different experience - visual
* explain synthetic vs RUM
* some example code
* gotchas: browser support
* gotchas: load abandonment
* keep synthetic in your pipeline
* keep synthetic simple

# summary
* user-centric metrics + RUM rock
* thanks/questions
